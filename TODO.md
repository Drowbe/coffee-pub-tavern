# To do

Things agreed on but not built yet, roughly in order. See the Studio repo's own TODO.md
for that app's side of things (Windows OBS capture work, mainly).

## Architecture: a list is not an editor

A list view's job is to show what exists and let you pick one -- not to host a form for
editing it. Click an item, land on a page that is *about that one thing*. Users worked
this way first (`/profile/<key>`, replacing a flat admin table full of per-row fields);
rooms now work the same way (`/rooms/<id>`, replacing per-card fields and a member
checklist grid in the Rooms tab). Both list tabs are now just a roster: a thumbnail, a
name, a status line, a link. Keep new admin surfaces to this shape rather than growing
another inline editor on a list -- it is why the two existing ones scaled badly enough to
need rebuilding.

## Studio needs to read a room's profile

A room's **profile** (Roleplaying / Participants / Characters, set on its config page) now
decides which of the Participant and Character image groups actually exist for it -- both
on a member's per-room profile section and, in principle, in what Coffee Pub Studio should
offer to publish. Studio doesn't read `room.profile` yet, so today it still offers Character
sources for a Participants-only room (and vice versa) with nothing behind them. Studio's own
TODO.md should pick this up: fetch the room's profile alongside its members and grey out (or
just not build) the source kind the profile doesn't offer.

## Desktop sharing

Not started. A way to share a screen or window into the room, alongside (or instead of)
the camera -- the usual video-call feature, not yet offered here.

## Scheduling

Not started. A way to schedule when a room's session happens next (date/time, maybe a
recurrence) and let members see it -- session logistics currently live outside the app
entirely.

## Guest participants

Not started. Someone joins with just a name -- no account, no profile, a generic "guest" set
of Participant images standing in for the usual per-user ones -- and is removed the moment
they leave, with nothing kept about them afterward. Needs its own join path (distinct from
signing in or a personal link) and a way for the table/OBS side to render a guest tile
without a real user key behind it.

## Follow the admin: who drives the stream

Right now "the admin" the stream follows is picked as "the first admin, in user-list
order, who happens to be online" -- an accident of implementation, not a real choice. With
one admin it is harmless; with two, the stream can follow the wrong one regardless of who
is actually operating OBS. The fix is separating two things that are currently the same
flag: *who is an admin* (a permissions role) from *whose location drives the stream* (a
stream-operator role) -- e.g. a `streamsFrom` flag on a user, defaulting to the sole admin
when there is only one, settable when there is more than one.

## Multiple simultaneous asides, and a director-style switch

The real shape (confirmed in conversation, not yet built): one main room continues
normally while one *or more* asides run alongside it at once (3 players splitting into 3
different side conversations; a group of 9 breaking into 3 groups of 3), with the admin
able to move between them -- and, separately, a producer-style ability to point the
recording at any live group without necessarily being in it themselves (this is the same
underlying fix as the `streamsFrom` split above: someone directing the stream, distinct
from any single participant's own physical presence).

This is bigger than the "one aside, GM plus N" work already shipped -- treat it as its own
design pass, not a quick extension. The data model already allows more than one `ephemeral`
room to exist at once; what's missing is a way to move between existing asides (today you
can only create a new one) and the operator-switch capability above.
